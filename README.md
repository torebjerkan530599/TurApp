Description
Based on the previous deliveries and product work, the final version of your mobile application, v1.0, is now going to be a reality. There are still some functionality, design and cleanup needed before you can deploy your application to a store. Since this is the last step and a crucial one, the features, design and documentation all need to be revised, improved and tested. 

Design: A clean, functional and intriguing design is what makes or breaks the interest from customers wanting to start using your applications. Below are some features which might be good to have/implemented and so on. 
Introduction page with a nice overview of the features in your application
Easy to use interface between pages/functionality/map
Choice of colors
Settings
Dark mode, language ++
Icons
Showing activity level, type of exercise, user choice?
Animation and transitions between different views/fragments
A credit page showing of the developers (name and product idea)
Application Logo and style
Features: There are certain features that are required for the application, and some might just be a good idea. First implement all the required features, then move onto imaginative functionality
[Required] Background tracking (service)
[Suggestion] Start, stop, pause, delete tracking on the fly with all associated data gathered
[Suggestion] Filtered tracking for better performance/error handling
[Required] Map view with overlay (position, tracked routes)
[Suggestion] Show previous tracked routes with filtering possibilities 
[Suggestion] Heatmap of all tracked routes
[Suggestion] Tiles and tile-options for changing between styles in OSM 
[Required] AR view (when a POI is available, give and option after press to view location in AR)
[Suggestion] Use an Icon or other type of resource to visualize a category (shown below in suggestions)
[Required] Camera snapshot (take pictures along a hike/walk/exploration) 
[Suggestion] Possibility to show images in map view
[Suggestion] Gallery view for showing all pictures taken for a finished track
[Suggestion] Combine a snapshot of the map(finished route) with a picture taken (if available) in a history view
[Suggestion] User statistics (achievements, overview, training curves, efficiency ++)
[Suggestion] Track categories (Hike, fishing, hunting, cycling, competition ++)
[Creativity] What differs your application from others, highlight good features. This is a very important point and will count a good amount towards the 40pts available in this section.  

Documentation: A product should contain some basic information about features and known issues, including screenshots and promotion material. You should create a short product documentation about all the features you have implemented (this is more extensive than a poster/store page). 
Product documentation
Document your products features as well as known bugs (2-3 pages)
Poster
Create a small poster showing of your applications (i.e. what would have been in the store page)
Self evaluation where you explain you involvement in the project, what have been working/not working in your team.

Task
Implement, test and validate you applications with regards to the above mentioned design and features, and also update/create a document containing information about your application. Update your poster with new screenshots/information and also write a short self evaluation to be delivered individually. The [Required] category is mostly functionality you have already implemented (with the exception of AR) and are therefore required (attempted) implemented in the final version. All other features, testing, functionality [Suggestion] is good to have and should not directly be implemented, but suggested added content. The most important part is the last feature [Creativity]!

Delivery: The delivery required for this project is
A .apk file (installable on a random device)
Documentation as a dte_2503_TEAMID_P2_documentation .pdf. This includes the poster (last page of the documentation)
dte_2503_TEAMID_P2_code.zip (Including the resources and all necessary files)
Each member should deliver a self evaluation individually (1/2 page). The self evaluation is to be sent to: aleksander.pedersen@uit.no

Evaluation:
The project is evaluated with a maximum score of 100 points, divided into these categories:
10 pts - Project management: Clean and commented code, Android Studio project structure, file/database storage.
25 pts - Application: Design
45 pts - Application: Features
10 pts - Documentation: System doc
10 pts - Documentation: Poster
Required - Presentation: Product presentation on 7. December with an external evaluator. This is mandatory and no-show means grade F in this project.
