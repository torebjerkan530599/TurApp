Description
Based on the previous deliveries and product work, the final version of your mobile application, v1.0, is now going to be a reality. There are still some functionality, design and cleanup needed before you can deploy your application to a store. Since this is the last step and a crucial one, the features, design and documentation all need to be revised, improved and tested. 

Design: A clean, functional and intriguing design is what makes or breaks the interest from customers wanting to start using your applications. Below are some features which might be good to have/implemented and so on. 
Introduction page with a nice overview of the features in your application
Easy to use interface between pages/functionality/map
Choice of colors
Settings
Dark mode, language ++
Icons
Showing activity level, type of exercise, user choice?
Animation and transitions between different views/fragments
A credit page showing of the developers (name and product idea)
Application Logo and style
